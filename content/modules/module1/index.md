If you still feel like its not very clear how generating good business ideas works. <a style="color:#3498db" href="https://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Read this amazing essay by Paul Graham</a>. This will clear everything out. Long read but definitely worth it.  


Now, it's really important that you can explain what your idea is to someone who knows nothing about it. Thus, you need a simple one-liner that can be the face of your idea. It’s a great skill to be able to condense your idea into one single line. Read the article below to learn how to convert your ideas into a one-liner. There are many examples of established startups to help you understand what an ideal one-liner should look like.

# Part 2: Apply What You've Learned
>**Time to put those ideas to the test! Follow the instructions below to start generating your own business idea.**

## Instructions

<div style="font-size:20px">

1. Brainstorm <span style="color:#F05555;">**at least 3 business ideas**</span> using one of the techniques from the resources above. Be open-minded and **write down every idea**, even the crazy ones!

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

2. Narrow it down to <span style="color:#F05555;">**one idea**</span> that excites you and has market potential. Think about its feasibility and whether it's aligned with your goals. Choose the one you’re most passionate to explore and feel like ***“Yeah man this is something that needs to be there and I can get it done!!"***

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

3. Now it's time to convert your idea into a <span style="color:#F05555;">**one-liner**</span>. Use the <a style="color:#3498db" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C6__bjT2l1T1FH7GXMIpyO_l__uCLNrsNpCK8x_ioOs/edit?usp=sharing">one-liner template here</a>. **Do not edit directly on the template document**. Create a copy of the template document in your accounts. Choose any slide you prefer (whichever colour speaks to you the most). Edit it with your one-liner. 

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>
