[{"content":" Welcome to Module 5 This module is about turning your product idea into a toy prototype — a basic, functional/non-functional model that represents the essence of your product.\nThis step helps you visualise your concept and explain it more effectively during the final presentation. Remember, your prototype doesn’t need to be perfect or functional — focus on how well it conveys your idea! Part 1: Prototyping Resources Learn Before You Build A simple guide to understand the fundamentals of prototyping and how to start. Explore the steps, methods, and mindset for creating impactful prototypes. http://www.projectmanager.com/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype (More suitable for software ideas) Tips to Keep in Mind It’s Your Call: Your prototype can range from a sketch to a 3D-printed model—it’s totally up to you. Levels of Detail Matter: A detailed sketch explaining the functions of every part can be better than a poorly made 3D model. Similarly, a well-thought-out 3D prototype can bring your product to life. Focus on Communication: The goal is to explain your idea visually and clearly. Iterate \u0026amp; Experiment: Don’t hesitate to test multiple designs. Your first attempt doesn’t have to be the final one. Simplify: Use basic materials (paper, cardboard, etc.) if necessary—simplicity is key. Part 2: Update Submission Now that you’ve reviewed the resources and tips, it’s time to create and submit your prototype.\nStep-by-Step Instructions 1. Prototype Design Describe the purpose of your prototype and what it represents. Highlight how your design connects to your product idea from Module 4. Let the organising comm know if you would like to use Garage’s 3D printers. We’d try our best to make those available. 2. Prototype Showcase Submit any combination of photos or sketches of your prototype. Focus on the appearance, structure, and form (not actual functionality). 3. Design Explanation Provide a brief explanation (3-5 sentences) about your prototype: Why did you choose this design? How does it communicate your product’s core idea? Update 5 Submission Details Format: Submit photos/videos with a short written explanation.
