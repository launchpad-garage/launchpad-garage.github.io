<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1 style="font-size:60px">Welcome to Module 4</h1>
<p style="font-size:26px"> This module is about turning your product idea into a toy prototype—a basic, functional/non-functional model that represents the essence of your product.</b></p>
<p> Keep note that this is not the module where you need to create or design it to perfection, but the module where you need to decide what are the must-have characteristics for the prototype and things like what is the best way to make this prototype (for eg. materials, collaborations, etc)</p>

# Part 2: Update Submission

---

Now that you’ve completed your initial research in Part 1, it’s time to compile your findings and submit an <b>update document</b>. Follow the steps below to structure your research document:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prototype Functionality

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Briefly describe <span style="color:#F05555;">how your prototype will work</span>.
- Highlight its key functions and intended purpose.

</div>

### 2. Prototype Creation Plan

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Explain how your prototype can be made.
- Include:
    - Possible materials or resources needed.
    - Manufacturing processes or tools (e.g., 3D printing, molding).
    - Software platforms (if applicable).


</div>

### 3. Potential Collaborations in Singapore

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Identify any <span style="color:#F05555;">institutions, organizations, or local companies</span> that could assist with prototype development (e.g., material suppliers, tech hubs, or mentors).

</div>

### 4. Feasibility Analysis

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Assess the feasibility of your design:
    - Cost-effectiveness of materials and resources.
    - Availability of required tools/platforms.
    - Timeline for prototype creation.

</div>

### 5. Challenges and Solutions

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- List potential challenges you foresee in creating the prototype.
- Propose solutions to overcome these challenges.
