<h1 style="font-size:60px">Welcome to Module 5</h1>
<p style="font-size:26px"> This module is about turning your product idea into a <b>toy prototype</b> — a basic, functional/non-functional model that represents the essence of your product.</p>
<p>This step helps you visualise your concept and explain it more effectively during the final presentation. Remember, your prototype doesn’t need to be perfect or functional — focus on how well it conveys your idea!

## Learn Before You Build

1. A simple guide to understand the fundamentals of prototyping and how to start.

2. Explore the steps, methods, and mindset for creating impactful prototypes. <a style="color:#3498db !important;" href="https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype">http://www.projectmanager.com/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype</a> (More suitable for software ideas)

## Tips to Keep in Mind

<div style="font-size:20px">

- <span style="color:#F05555;"><b>It’s Your Call:</b></span> Your prototype can range from a <span style="color:#F05555;">sketch</span> to a <span style="color:#F05555;">3D-printed model</span>—it’s totally up to you.

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

- <span style="color:#F05555;"><b>Levels of Detail Matter:</b></span> A detailed sketch explaining the functions of every part can be better than a poorly 
made 3D model. Similarly, a well-thought-out 3D prototype can bring your product to life.

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

- <span style="color:#F05555;"><b>Focus on Communication:</b></span> The goal is to explain your idea visually and clearly.

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

- <span style="color:#F05555;"><b>Iterate & Experiment:</b></span> Don’t hesitate to test multiple designs. Your first attempt doesn’t have to be the final one.

<div style="margin-bottom:20px"></div>

- <span style="color:#F05555;"><b>Simplify:</b></span> Use basic materials (paper, cardboard, etc.) if necessary—simplicity is key.

# Part 2: Update Submission

---

Now that you’ve reviewed the resources and tips, it’s time to create and submit your prototype.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prototype Design

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Describe the purpose of your prototype and what it represents.
- Highlight how your design connects to your product idea from <span style="color:#F05555;">Module 4.</span>
- Let the organising comm know if you would like to use Garage’s 3D printers. We’d try our best to make those available. 

</div>

 
### 2. Prototype Showcase

<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Submit any combination of <span style="color:#F05555;">photos</span> or <span style="color:#F05555;">sketches</span> of your prototype.
- Focus on the appearance, structure, and form (not actual functionality).

</div>


### 3. Design Explanation


<div style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-left:40px">

- Provide a <span style="color:#F05555;">brief explanation (3-5 sentences)</span> about your prototype:
    -  Why did you choose this design?
    - How does it communicate your product’s core idea?

</div>
